            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and regulate your own emotions as well as understanding the emotions of others. I think it is part empathy, part self-awareness and it’s hugely beneficial for creating and maintaining healthy relationships.

            <h4><em>How is it different to IQ?</em></h4>
            <p>
                IQ can be quantifiably measured; EQ is less tangible in the sense that it can’t be measured to the same degree. EQ is more a reflection on your ability to perceive people and how other people perceive you as a person. While it can’t be assigned a number, you could say that EQ can be measured by the success of a person’s relationships and even their happiness and self-awareness. I hesitate to use the term good person but that is what springs to mind.

            <h4><em>Why is it important?</em></h4>
            <p>
                It is important for managing your own emotions, thought processes and stress. This in turn will help improve the quality of your communications with others, along with your skills as a leader and team member. Being able to regulate and control your own emotions and emotional responses to different situations can also make you a happier and more fulfilled person.
