                <h4><em>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</em></h4>
                <p>
                    Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity increases your capacity to learn and increases performance as a result. A study in the journal Child Development in 2007 ‘found that both morale and grade points took a leap when students understood the idea that intelligence is malleable’.

                <h4><em>Discuss how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</em></h4>
                <p>
                    I think completing these reflections on the subject should give me some benefit, if the source material is correct then even understanding the subject should provide tangible benefits. The idea that practice makes perfect isn’t a new one, but for my own process I know that it is extremely helpful in learning new skills so that is something I will try to replicate myself even if the curriculum doesn’t. Putting information in context is a big one for me as well, I feel like understanding why you are doing something is what gives the information context for me. However, this seems to appose the ‘just in time’ style of learning which is being pushed for some information. I guess I must trust in the process and see how I get on.

                <h4><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</em></h4>
                <p>
                    Awareness of the concepts, practice, practice and practice and putting information in context.

                <h3 style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h3>
                <h4><em>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</em></h4>
                <p>
                    This seems to link to neuroplasticity in the sense that having an awareness of how intelligence is malleable is part of having a growth mindset. For me the difference between the two is that growth mindset seems to take into account the understanding of others intelligence and how that can affect your empathy and ability to work as part of a team. With growth mindset there is a focus on happiness and positive emotional responses rather than more tangible results like increased learning and intelligence.

                <p>
                    Not really, this seems to be a bit more of a deep dive that was covered in the pre-curriculum work. I do find it interesting though and I guess going over these topics again is only improving my awareness of it and will hopefully benefit me as a result.

                <h4><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></h4>
                <p>
                    I will try and incorporate the concept into my group work when working with others who maybe aren’t understanding concepts as quickly as others. Also using it in self-reflection in the same way.

                    I enjoyed <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">this</a> article as it gave examples that resonate with me like basketball and the gym which I have both enjoyed.

                <h4><em>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</em></h4>
                <p>
                    To be honest I’m not sure. Practicing and context are both things that I would be incorporating already. I guess having awareness can be linked with the mindfulness part of my learning plan. Making sure that I am practicing mindfulness could help me take a step back and be more aware of myself and how I am interpreting the curriculum throughout the process, this in turn could help with increasing my awareness of neuroplasticity and help reap the benefits.
