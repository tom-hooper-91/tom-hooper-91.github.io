                        During my work as an Electrician, there were times when there was pressure to carry out work that would make most financial sense for the company and keep the client happy but would be against Electrical Regulations. Some of these regulations I know to be overly cautious and to expect the worst-case scenario. During my years of work, I knew many Electricians who would carry out work such as this with no issue, to make their lives easier.

                    <p>
                        It is hard to say no, and that is exactly what you would have to do in these situations to follow the regulations. I knew that the odds of something going wrong and causing someone harm were very minimal, but if I chose to carry out this work, I felt it would be a slippery slope and that in the future it would get easier and easier just to say yes and just take the easy way out. Making what I thought was the right decision was sometimes difficult, it could involve creating extra work for myself and potentially causing some friction between myself, clients, or employers. However, I feel like explaining my rationale and thought processes that I could walk away at the end of the day with peace of mind. On reflection what this scenario shows is that given the choice of what I felt was right and what was easy I stuck to my principles and chose what I felt to be right, sometimes at my own expense.

                        Being born and raised in London has been a big part of shaping who I am as a person. Growing up in a very multicultural city and being raised by parents who embraced that aspect of society meant that I was exposed to a wide variety of people and cultures from a young age. I believe this is why I am such a big fan of experiencing and learning new things, from foreign countries and cuisines to new skills or hobbies. It has also instilled me with sense of empathy and equality, with the knowledge that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to achieve their goals and be happy.

                    <p>
                        I believe that my strengths are my problem solving and communication skills, along with a drive to succeed in what I do. Embracing change is what eventually led me to the decision to retrain and study with EDA. My limitations are motivation when I don’t have interest in what I am doing or feel stimulated and challenged. This is also a big part of what has led me to this point in my life.

                    <p>
                        My strength in problem solving and enjoyment of the process despite frustration are what will help me in this learning environment. I know there will be times during my studies and future career where there are problems that I have trouble solving, but providing I embrace the process and seek advice from mentor figures where I need it, I believe I will have success.

                        Working with other students on an assignment for a course through the Open Polytechnic there were issues with one member of the team. He would not engage during group discussion and the quality of his work was poor. I tried to reach out to him and offer my help, but I didn’t receive any reply. I decided to discuss my concerns with another team member and come up with a strategy of how best to approach the situation. We decided together that we would use his idea for his section of the project but reformat the wording ourselves to bring it up to standard. This seemed to work well, as the project itself was a success but I do not know if his individual contribution would have been enough for him to pass the assignment. If I had the opportunity to do this again, I would make more of an effort to support him directly to try and understand his issues and work with him to achieve a better result.
