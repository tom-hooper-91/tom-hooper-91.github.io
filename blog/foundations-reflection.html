            <h4 class="sub-title"><em>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</em></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>I have learned that sometimes I am too quick to judge myself and others, intelligence is malleable and everyone deserves a chance to grow.</li>
                <li>I am a competitive person and sometimes need to keep my ego in check, particularly when seeking help from others.</li>
                <li>Mindfulness is a great tool to help regulate your emotions and helps to cultivate logical thinking and problem solving.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4><em>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em></h4>
            <p>
                These three things are hugely important for working in a team and understanding your engagements with others and with the curriculum when you are learning. Understanding your own values can help you consciously make decisions you are happy with and that are beneficial to yourself and those around you. Empathy allows you form successful relationships with those around you, creating a positive working environment. Self-awareness is hugely important for logical thinking, stress management and self-fulfilment.
            </p>
            <h4><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em></h4>
            <p>
                How important it is in the context of being a successful developer. That writing perfect code is almost irrelevant if you are not able to work effectively with others and build solid relationships.
            </p>
            <h4><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</em></h4>
            <p>
                It is essential for getting hired and being a successful part of a team. You can have all the knowledge in the world, but if people don’t want to work with you, you’re not going to be successful or get the job you want.
            </p>
            <h4><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer</em></h4>
            <p>
                Not at all, there has not been a huge amount of core content, just enough to make sure it is a relevant part of the process. It is clear from hearing accounts of successful professionals and interacting with people already established in the industry how important this part of the course is.
