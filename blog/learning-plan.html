            <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        My long-term goal is to become a skilled developer who works on projects that are meaningful and interesting to me. I love the idea of one day being able to contribute or create to a project that people will use to improve their life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My strengths are my problem-solving skills and my curiosity. If something doesn’t work, I want to find out why and I am used to breaking down larger problems into small manageable chunks. My curiosity helps my tackle new problems and pick up new skills. My main limitation in the context of learning is that if I am not interested or challenged by something I can lose motivation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I would like to see my collaborative skills developed during my time at EDA. I am used to working independently and sometimes find it difficult accepting other people’s decisions if I believe there is a better way of doing something. I will be mindful of this and make a conscious effort to address during group work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To manage my workload during this course I will use the pomodoro method and take regular short breaks to help maintain a good level of concentration throughout. I will commit to a specific number of pomodoros each day depending on workload. Hopefully as I progress through the course I'll have a better understanding of how long tasks will take. I will also use timeboxes to assist this where possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When things are building up and starting to get to me the first thing I will do is talk to someone; whether it is a teammate, facilitator or even a friend or my partner. I will take a step back from the situation and work out what Is causing my frustration. If it is a particular problem I am stuck on, I will ask for help if I need it. If the workload is too much I will either ask for help or find a way to approach the problem differently to fit in the required time slot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a rule of thumb if I am stuck on the same problem for 4 pomodoros (2 hours) I will ask someone for help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I expect that the facilitator team will help me when I need it and will be able to explain the solution to me rather than just solving it themselves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have no scheduling commitments other than this course currently.
