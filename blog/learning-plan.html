            <h4><em>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</em></h4>
            <p>
              I want to become a skilled and competent senior developer and work for a company who has a product or mission that I am passionate about and that improves the quality of people’s lives.
            </p>

            <h4><em>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</em></h4>
            <p>
              I think I have solid logical problem-solving skills and a real curiosity to learn new skills and techniques. I am also a person who enjoys meeting and learning about new people and cultures, which should be a good attribute when working in teams. However, it may take me time to adapt to working in an office environment for long periods of time, this is still something I am not used to and need to break up my day with some form of exercise. I am sure I will also become frustrated if I do not understand something that my peers are. In these situations, I need to put my ego aside, ask for help when I need it, and be mindful of the fact that this is a journey where people learn at their own pace. 
            </p>

            <h4><em>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</em></h4>
            <p>
              I think it will be my body adjusting to the amount of time working in an office or classroom environment. I need to continue to take regular short breaks to move around and try to exercise during the day if possible.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4><em>What non-technical skills – human skills – would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </em></h4>
            <p>
              I would like to see my empathy and patience improve whilst at EDA, patience with myself as well as other’s. I hope that working collaboratively on projects will help strengthen these skills.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4><em>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</em></h4>
            <p>
              To have a solid foundational knowledge of the content they are providing and be able to explain concepts in a way that allows us as students to solve problems on our own. To provide feedback throughout the process, including constructive criticism where needed.
            </p>

            <h4><em>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</em></h4>
            <p>
              I do not expect to understand everything straight away, when something does not make sense to me, I will ask for help when I need it. This is different from being stuck on a piece of code and asking for help straight away, I still want to problem solve independently where possible to help build my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will continue working to the pomodoro method, as this has helped me keep focused so far. Where possible I will stop every 25 minutes for a 5-minute break, during this time I will move, stretch, and do whatever I feel my body needs. I would rather spend more hours during the day working or on campus, than try to cram everything into one session and not allow my brain and body to take small breaks. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I will work long days and weekends where needed. I will talk to my peers and staff when I have issues, emotionally as well as in relation to the course material. I will not suffer in silence.
